# Linear-Programming
Linear Programming using pulp, milp,scipy, and Gurobi in python

Linear Programming is Convex Optimization Program, where we find optimal solution by giving some constraints

Useful in supply chain management, logistics, investment banking, Public health, design, manufacturing, statistics

Terms used
1. objective Variables
2. Decision Variables : they are the variables which will decide my ouput
3. Objective Function: Goal/ objective of making decisions, what we want to achieve (maximize/ minimize)
4. Constraints: the restrictions or limitations on the decision variables. they usually limit the value of decision variables. they shape how you obtain the objective.
5. Non-negativity restrictions: For all linear programs, the deciaion variables should always take non-negative values. which means the values for decision variables should be greater than or equal to 0.

Packages used

1. pip install 
       pulp
       milp
       scipy
